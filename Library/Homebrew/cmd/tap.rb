        description <<~EOS
          Tap a formula repository.
          If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

          With <URL> unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.
          Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for
          `brew tap` <user>`/`<repo> `https://github.com/`<user>`/homebrew-`<repo>.

          With <URL> specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using
          any transport protocol that `git`(1) handles. The one-argument form of `tap`
          simplifies but also limits. This two-argument command makes no
          assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and
          using protocols other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.
